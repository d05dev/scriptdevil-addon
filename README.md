## ScriptDevil: A simple Lua editor inside of World of Warcraft.

Edit, save, and run Lua scripts in a clean multi-line editor. Great for debugging and quickly building interfaces at runtime.

⚠️ **NOTE:** Only WoW Classic is supported at this time. Feel free to edit the ToC file to run on retail, but may not function properly.

### *Installation*
1. [Download the ScriptDevil github ZIP](https://github.com/d05dev/scriptdevil-addon/archive/refs/heads/master.zip).
2. Unzip the directory, find the folder named "ScriptDevil", and drag it into your wow addons folder (typically /World of Warcraft/_classic_era/Interface/AddOns/).
3. Enter /sd or /scriptdevil into chat to open the addon.

### *Demo*
Run a pong game! Paste the code from the provided pong-example.lua file into ScriptDevil's text editor and click 'run' to see it in action.

### Troubleshooting
**"It's not showing up in the addons section at character selection"**
- Did you unzip the downloaded directory?
- Did you make sure to only add the folder named "ScriptDevil" to your addons, and not the entire directory downloaded from here?
- Are you in the correct addon folder path? Make sure your addon folder corresponds to your correct game version.
